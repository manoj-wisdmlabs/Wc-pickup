**WooCommerce Pickup**
Description:
The WooCommerce Pickup & Reminder plugin enhances your WooCommerce store by allowing customers to select a pickup location and date at checkout. It streamlines the pickup process by sending confirmation emails with store details, including a map location, and a reminder email one day before the scheduled pickup. Admins can manage store locations easily from the backend.
